      "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it consists of a broad spectrum of colors, including all the colors of the rainbow.\n",
      "2. **Scattering occurs**: As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light.\n",
      "3. **Shorter wavelengths scatter more**: When sunlight hits these gas molecules, the shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered in all directions by the molecules. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it in 1871.\n",
      "4. **Blue light dominates**: Because blue light has a relatively short wavelength (around 450-495 nanometers), it is scattered more than other colors, such as red or orange light, which have longer wavelengths (600-700 nanometers). As a result, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere.\n",
      "5. **Our eyes perceive the sky as blue**: When we look up at the sky on a clear day, our eyes see the scattered blue light more intensely than any other color. This is why the sky typically appears blue to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* During sunrise and sunset, when the sun is low in the sky, the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. As a result, longer wavelengths like red and orange are scattered less and can dominate our view, making the sky appear more reddish.\n",
      "* At high altitudes or in areas with significant atmospheric pollution, the blue color may be less prominent due to the presence of larger particles that scatter light differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you know why the sky is blue!\n"
